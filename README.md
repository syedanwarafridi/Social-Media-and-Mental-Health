# Social Media Usage and Mental Health Analysis

This repository contains code and resources related to an analysis of the relationship between social media usage and mental health. The project explores various aspects of this connection, including the impact of social media on self-reported depression levels, time-series analysis of usage patterns and feelings of restlessness, and clustering of respondents based on their social media behavior and mental health profiles.

## Key Features:

**Data Preprocessing:** The project includes data preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and standardizing data.

**Machine Learning:** It employs a range of machine learning techniques, including logistic regression, random forest, and support vector machines to model and predict different mental health aspects.

**Statistical Analysis:** The repository demonstrates how to conduct statistical tests such as ANOVA to investigate differences in mental health related to various social media platforms.

**Clustering Analysis:** Clustering algorithms, such as K-means, are used to group respondents based on their social media usage and mental health profiles.

**Time Series Analysis:** The project conducts time series analysis to explore how social media usage patterns and feelings of restlessness have changed over time.

**Interpretation and Reporting:** The results are interpreted and presented in a clear and informative manner.

Feel free to explore the code and resources to gain insights into the complex relationship between social media usage and mental health."
